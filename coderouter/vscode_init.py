"""v2.10-A: ``coderouter vscode-init`` — one-shot VSCode workspace scaffolder.

Writes ``.vscode/settings.json`` with ``terminal.integrated.env.*`` so a
Claude Code session launched from VSCode's integrated terminal
auto-points at CodeRouter. Optionally emits a direnv ``.envrc`` in the
same run.

The design contract:

* stdlib only — no new runtime deps (keeps the strict-5 rule in
  ``pyproject.toml`` intact).
* Never overwrite unrelated keys in an existing ``settings.json``. Only
  ``terminal.integrated.env.osx`` / ``.linux`` / ``.windows`` are
  touched, and inside them only the CodeRouter-managed env vars.
* When an existing target value differs from the desired one, refuse
  without ``--force`` and print a unified diff so the operator decides.
* ``--dry-run`` is byte-identical to the write path minus the actual
  ``os.replace`` at the end.
* All writes are atomic (``tempfile.mkstemp`` + ``fsync`` +
  ``os.replace``) so a partial write cannot corrupt an existing
  ``settings.json``. This matters more here than in most CodeRouter
  modules because the file we're editing is workspace-critical: a
  broken JSON blob would silently break every VSCode terminal env
  until a human debugged it.
* Nothing an operator wrote is destroyed without a copy: before any
  existing file is rewritten, its previous bytes (and mode) land in
  ``<name>.bak``, which ``coderouter rollback`` can swap back.
* Since v2.14.0, ``.envrc`` is edited through a marker-delimited block
  (``# BEGIN coderouter-managed`` … ``# END coderouter-managed``): only
  that block is rewritten and every other line survives byte-for-byte.
  A re-run over an already-fenced file therefore needs no ``--force``;
  ``--force`` now means "adopt a file I did not write". Before v2.14.0
  this was a whole-file replace, which is how the lost
  ``source_env_if_exists .envrc.local`` line (H-11) happened — see the
  "marker-delimited managed block in .envrc" section below for the full
  rationale and the conflict rules.
* A freshly generated ``.envrc`` is created 0600 — it carries
  ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`` and sits next to the operator's real
  secrets. An existing file's mode is preserved across rewrites
  instead of being reset to the umask default by ``os.replace``.

Files touched (opt-in per flag):

* ``{target}/.vscode/settings.json`` — always
* ``{target}/.envrc``                 — ``--with-envrc``

Non-Claude-Code extensions (Cline / Roo / Kilo / Continue) are handled
by the cheat sheet printed to stdout at end of run and the fuller
``docs/guides/vscode.md`` — this CLI deliberately does NOT reach into
those extensions' settings, because each ships its own config schema
that changes with its own release cadence.

CLI plumbing lives in :mod:`coderouter.cli` (``_run_vscode_init``); this
module is import-clean so tests can exercise ``run_vscode_init``
directly without argparse in the way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target:
        Workspace root — the folder that VSCode opens. ``.vscode/`` and
        (if ``with_envrc``) ``.envrc`` are placed under this directory.
        Must already exist as a directory; we do not create the
        workspace root itself.
    port:
        CodeRouter port for ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``. Defaults to 8088
        (docs-standard); override to match a non-default ``serve``.
    profile:
        Optional ``CODEROUTER_MODE`` value to preload. When set, the
        VSCode terminal gets ``CODEROUTER_MODE=<profile>`` too.
    with_envrc:
        When true, also write ``.envrc`` (direnv). Idempotent and
        conflict-aware just like ``settings.json``.
    dry_run:
        When true, compute all the outcomes and diffs but skip the
        actual ``os.replace``. Guarantees byte-parity with the write
        path — see the module docstring for the invariant.
    force:
        When true, existing conflicting values are overwritten. Without
        this flag, a conflict is reported with a diff and the file is
        left untouched.

    Raises
    ------

        The target directory does not exist. All other issues (bad

# generated contents over whatever was there, dropping any line the operator
# had added. That is how H-11 happened, and "we back it up first" only helps
# somebody who knows to look for the backup.
#
# The fix is the one codex-router uses on ``~/.codex/config.toml``: fence the
# part we own between markers, rewrite only that, and leave everything else
# byte-for-byte. Once the fence exists, a re-run is no longer destructive, so
# it needs no ``--force`` at all — ``--force`` shrinks back to its honest
# meaning of "yes, adopt a file I did not write".

# operator would have no idea which one is live.
