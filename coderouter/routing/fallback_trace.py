"""v2.15.0: request-scoped fallback trace — *why* did the chain move?

Before v2.15.0 the engine could tell an operator (via ``try-provider`` /
``provider-failed`` log lines) that a fallback happened, but nothing tied
the two together into a single "we left A for B because of R" record, and
nothing at all reached the *client*. This module is that missing record.

Vocabulary
==========

``reason`` already existed in the codebase as a keyword argument on
:func:`coderouter.routing.capability.log_capability_degraded`
(``provider-does-not-support`` / ``translation-lossy`` /
``unsupported-backend``) and on the drift verdict. Those are **degrade**
reasons: the request stays on the same provider, something is stripped.
v2.15.0 keeps those strings verbatim (they are re-exported here as
``REASON_PROVIDER_DOES_NOT_SUPPORT`` etc. so there is one place to read
the whole vocabulary) and adds the **fallback** reasons — the ones that
actually move the request to a different provider.

Only fallback reasons ever produce a :class:`FallbackHop`. Degrade
reasons never do, by construction: nothing moved.

Fallback reasons split in two families:

*Pre-attempt* (the provider was filtered out of the chain during
:meth:`FallbackEngine._resolve_chain`, so it was never called):
``paid-gate`` / ``budget-exceeded`` / ``memory-pressure`` /
``backend-unhealthy`` / ``self-healing-excluded`` / ``unknown-provider``.

*Attempt-failure* (the provider was called and did not deliver):
``timeout`` / ``rate-limit`` / ``auth`` / ``upstream-5xx`` /
``upstream-4xx`` / ``connection`` / ``upstream-error`` /
``empty-response`` / ``empty-stream``.

Request scoping
===============

The trace lives in a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar`, the same isolation
mechanism the drift verdict (``_drift_verdict_ctx``) and the M11 prepared
dispatch (``_prepared_dispatch_ctx``) already use in
:mod:`coderouter.routing.fallback`. Starlette runs each request handler in
its own asyncio task, so one request never sees another's hops, and the
value cannot go stale across requests (the ContextVar defaults to
``None``).

Two entry points, deliberately different:

* :func:`begin_fallback_trace` — installs a *fresh* trace. Called by the
  engine's dispatch entry points. ``keep_existing=True`` preserves a trace
  the ingress's ``apply_context_budget`` pre-pass already started for the
  same request (chain-resolve skips are recorded there, before dispatch).
* :func:`current_fallback_trace` — read-only lookup. The ingress uses it
  after dispatch to build the ``X-CodeRouter-Fallback-*`` headers and the
  ``coderouter_fallback`` SSE metadata event.

Ordering / shape contract (what a client can rely on)
=====================================================

For a request that fell back twice::

    X-CodeRouter-Fallback-From:   local
    X-CodeRouter-Fallback-To:     openrouter
    X-CodeRouter-Fallback-Reason: timeout,upstream-5xx
    X-CodeRouter-Fallback-Chain:  local>ollama>openrouter

``Chain`` is the providers in try-order; ``Reason`` is the reason for each
*departure*, in the same order. ``len(Chain) == len(Reason) + 1`` when the
chain finally produced an answer, and ``len(Chain) == len(Reason)`` when
the whole chain was exhausted (there was no provider to hand off to, so
``X-CodeRouter-Fallback-To`` is omitted). ``From`` is the first provider
that was abandoned, ``To`` the one that ultimately served.

None of these headers are emitted when no fallback happened — the
zero-fallback path is byte-for-byte unchanged from v2.14.0.
